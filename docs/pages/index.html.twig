Spark is a lightweight static site builder written in PHP. It is designed to effortlessly incorporate best-in-breed engineering tools and pratices into web development.

Spark uses Twig for templating and provides first class localization via the Symfony Translation Component. It also includes built-in deployment to Amazon S3 for cheap, reliable hosting.

Using this toolset, a spark site can be built and deployed around the world in a matter of hours, never goes down, and requires virtually zero systems administration experience to operate. Updates use the same repeatable process.

Spark was developed at [Riot Games](http://www.riotgames.com/) to build and deploy our [Game Info website](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/) and various [promotional](http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/tw/spirit-guard-udyr/) [pages](http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/fr/spirit-guard-udyr/) in over 10 languages, and the uptake for internal projects is rapidly increasing. Using Spark, a one-person team can deploy a scalable, secure website in front of tens of millions of viewers in only a few days.

## Requirements

- php 5.3 or higher. Find out if you already have php by running `php -v` in a terminal.

## Installation

1. Download spark.phar
2. In a terminal, run:

<!-- fix code block below getting sucked into the list -->

    sudo mv ~/Downloads/spark.phar /usr/local/bin/spark
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/spark

Get more [advanced instructions](./install/), including installing from source.

## Running Spark

Spark is a commandline tool which manages a spark project -- a directory containing a `spark.yml` file. Type `spark` at the terminal to see a list of commands. A basic workflow looks like this:

    $ spark init ~/my_project
    $ cd ~/my_project
    $ spark build
    $ spark preview

Now you can open <http://localhost:8000/en_US/> in your browser to see the English version and <http://localhost:8000/fr_FR/> for the French version.
