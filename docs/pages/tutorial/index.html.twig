@todo intro!

## Project Layout

When you run `spark init`, the following folders are created for you:

- `pages` where you put all of your site's pages live
- `assets` to hold things like css, images, javascript, etc. that will not be managed by the localization workflow
- `layouts` to hold shared templates / layouts that won't become pages on their own
- `locale` to hold your localization files
- `target` where spark will generate your static site (this is what you'll upload to your server / S3 bucket)

You can reconfigure these paths in `spark.yml` if you need a particular folder layout.

## Editing a Project

Spark uses [Twig templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation), which are similar to Django templates, and include a lot of cool stuff like template inheritance, includes, loops, and conditionals. Since Spark is built with PHP and [Symfony components](http://symfony.com/components) you can write custom PHP to do just about anything you want, like incorporate data from a database or rest API.
